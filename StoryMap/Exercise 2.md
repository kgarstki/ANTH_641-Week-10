# Week 10 Exercise 2 StoryMapJS

## Part One – Using StoryMap

In this activity we’ll be using [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) to create a storymap about the Duchess of Mecklenburg and her work excavating Iron Age burial mounds in Slovenia in the early 20th century. StoryMaps are interactive maps, coupled with a textual narrative, that often include different multimedia components. This platform provides a very cool way to share an archaeological narrative. 

1. Make sure the folder “Storymap material.zip” is downloaded from Canvas and unzipped. This will contain all of the material you’ll need to create the storymap along with this assignment. 

2. Go to StoryMapJS and click “Make a StoryMap.” It will ask you to log in with your google account – if you do not have an account, and you don’t want to create one, you can use the course account (contact Kevin). Once logged in start a new project. 

3. Follow the video to get comfortable with the dashboard used to edit your storymap. 

4. Start entering the Headlines, Text, Images, and location of the different sites outlined in the StoryMap Text and Location document (from your zipped folder). Throughout the process, check in on the preview to make sure you like what you’re creating, making changes where you want to. 

5. Once the StoryMap is complete, “publish” it and using the “Share” function, link to your map or embed it in your blog. 

## Part Two – Make your own StoryMap

I want you now to create a brand new StoryMap from the skills you learned above. You can use any dataset you’d like, as long as you have 5 entries (and an intro slide). Remember, you’re using this platform to tell a story that highlights the components of an archaeological context. Try to include enough description that a non-archaeologists can follow your narrative. 
Include the link to both StoryMaps you’ve created (from parts 1 and 2) in your blog post for the week.
